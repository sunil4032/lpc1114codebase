v0.50 - 8 December 2010
=======================

- Modified Chibi to use 16-bit timer 0 for us delays (more accurate)
- Added a flag to projectconfig.h to make FATFS read-only (to
  save a couple KB when space is tight).
- Moved 'project/eeprom.*' to 'drivers/eeprom' to add a level
  of abstraction to eeprom access throughout the code
- Added a table to projectconfig.h to try to keep track of pin and peripheral usage by drivers
  and the included SW examples.
- Added a simple pwm driver using 16-bit timer 1 and p1.9 (MAT0).  The code can be found
  in "/core/pwm".
- Added a bi-polar stepper motor driver based on the Arduino library.  Basic position data was added
  to detect deviation from the 'Home' position and to retrieve the spindle's current rotation.  See
  "drivers/motor/stepper" for more information.
- Added simple RSA encryption/decryption driver.  Currently limited to
  using 64-bit and 32-bit numbers in key pairs, which isn't terribly secure,
  but allows much smaller code size than if huge number support was included.
- Added a driver for the MCP4725 I2C DAC (see "drivers/dac/mcp4725").
- Updated Chibi to v0.90
- Modified FCLK_FAST() in 'drivers/fatfs/mmc.c' to set fast SPI speed
  to 9MHz instead of the previous 2MHz.

v0.30 - 7 October 2010
======================

- Moved command.c and cmd_tbl.h to /project to try to keep all project-specific files in one location
- Created seperate .c files for every command for the command-line interface to make it easier
  to maintain and share code between projects.  All commands listed in cmd_tbl.h are now stored
  in their own files in /project/commands (ex.: "/project/commands/cmd_hello.c", etc.)
- Add a CLI command to show the contents of any directory from the SD card 
  (/project/commmands/cmd_sd_dir.c)
- Added a CLI command showing how to enter deep-sleep and exit with a SW wakeup
  (/project/commands/cmd_deepsleep.c)
- Fixed pmu.c to set the core clock back to an appropriate state after wakeup

v0.21 - 21 September 2010
=========================

- Added ChaN's FATFS and a basic MMC/SDHC driver
- Added "drivers/lcd" and a prelimenary (experimental) driver for 128x64
  pixel ST7565-based bitmap LCDs (ex: http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=37&products_id=250)
