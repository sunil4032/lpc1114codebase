v0.31 - Ongoing
===============

- Added a simple pwm example using 16-bit timer 1 and p1.9 (MAT0).  The example can be found
  in "/drivers/pwm".
- Added a bi-polar stepper motor driver based on the Arduino library.  Basic position data was added
  to detect deviation from the 'Home' position and to retrieve the spindle's current rotation.  See
  "drivers/motor/stepper" for more information.

v0.30 - 7 October 2010
======================

- Moved command.c and cmd_tbl.h to /project to try to keep all project-specific files in one location
- Created seperate .c files for every command for the command-line interface to make it easier
  to maintain and share code between projects.  All commands listed in cmd_tbl.h are now stored
  in their own files in /project/commands (ex.: "/project/commands/cmd_hello.c", etc.)
- Add a CLI command to show the contents of any directory from the SD card 
  (/project/commmands/cmd_sd_dir.c)
- Added a CLI command showing how to enter deep-sleep and exit with a SW wakeup
  (/project/commands/cmd_deepsleep.c)
- Fixed pmu.c to set the core clock back to an appropriate state after wakeup

v0.21 - 21 September 2010
=========================

- Added ChaN's FATFS and a basic MMC/SDHC driver
- Added "drivers/lcd" and a prelimenary (experimental) driver for 128x64
  pixel ST7565-based bitmap LCDs (ex: http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=37&products_id=250)
